### Phase 4: Deployment and Maintenance

**1. Deployment Preparation:**

- Package the application for deployment (frontend, backend, and database).
- Conduct final testing on the staging environment.
- Ensure database migrations and environment configurations are correct.
- Set up continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.

**2. Deployment Execution:**

- Deploy the Reviwa application to a cloud platform (e.g., Render, Vercel, or AWS).
- Configure domain settings (e.g., `reviwa.com`).
- Test all features in the production environment for performance and reliability.

**3. Monitoring and Maintenance:**

- Implement monitoring tools (e.g., Google Analytics, uptime monitors, error logging).
- Establish a feedback channel for users to report issues.
- Perform routine database backups and software updates.
- Track bug reports, fix issues, and optimize system performance.

**4. Documentation and Training:**

- Prepare deployment documentation and maintenance guides.
- Train administrators or support staff on system use and troubleshooting.
- Maintain version control for future updates and feature releases.

**5. Future Enhancements:**

- Plan for mobile responsiveness improvements and PWA (Progressive Web App) integration.
- Introduce additional features like AI-based review summarization or real-time notifications.
- Conduct periodic user experience reviews to guide iterative updates.
