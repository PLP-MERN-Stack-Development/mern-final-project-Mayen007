# Phase 1: Planning and Requirements Gathering – Reviwa

## 1. Introduction

Reviwa (short for “Revive Waste”) is an SDG-aligned web application built using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). The project addresses **UN SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities** and **SDG 13: Climate Action** by promoting community-driven waste reporting and cleanup coordination.

Reviwa empowers citizens to report waste accumulation in their area, view community-led cleanup events, and collaborate with local authorities or NGOs to maintain cleaner, sustainable environments.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

Urban waste mismanagement is a growing issue in developing cities. Overflowing dumpsites, illegal dumping, and inefficient cleanup tracking lead to environmental degradation, blocked drainage systems, and poor public health outcomes. Existing solutions lack citizen engagement and real-time data integration.

**Reviwa** bridges this gap by connecting citizens, environmental groups, and local governments through an interactive platform for waste tracking and action coordination.

---

## 3. Goals and Objectives

- Enable users to report waste hotspots with images and geolocation.
- Allow NGOs or municipal teams to schedule and manage cleanup events.
- Promote environmental awareness and community participation.
- Build a scalable MVP that can expand regionally or integrate with local government waste systems.

---

## 4. UN SDG Alignment

- **SDG 11:** Sustainable Cities and Communities — by supporting efficient waste management and civic participation.
- **SDG 13:** Climate Action — by encouraging proactive community action and reducing pollution-related emissions.

---

## 5. Scope

The MVP will include:

- Waste reporting system (citizen-facing form)
- Interactive map showing reported areas
- Event coordination and participation system
- Admin dashboard for moderation and analytics
- Authentication and user profiles

Out of scope (for MVP): AI waste categorization, reward systems, and multi-language support (reserved for later phases).

## 6. Business Model and Monetization Strategy

**Reviwa** adopts a hybrid sustainability model combining social impact with revenue generation:

1. **Freemium Access for NGOs and Businesses:** Basic access is free, but advanced analytics and reporting tools require a subscription.
2. **Sponsored Campaigns:** Brands can sponsor cleanup events or run sustainability challenges.
3. **Data Licensing:** Provide anonymized environmental data to local governments or research institutions.
4. **Marketplace Partnerships:** Collaborate with eco-friendly product vendors or recyclers to feature offers within the app.
5. **CSR Integration:** Partner with corporations to manage CSR-funded cleanup programs through Reviwa.

## 8. Market Analysis

### a. Target Users

- Urban residents and environmental activists
- NGOs focused on waste management
- Local governments and municipal councils
- Environmental data researchers

### b. Market Gap

Most waste-reporting apps are either localized or lack two-way coordination between citizens and authorities. **Reviwa’s innovation** lies in combining geolocation-based reporting, event coordination, and impact tracking into one accessible platform.

### c. Competitor Overview

| Competitor          | Description                          | Limitation                    |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| CleanCity (Nigeria) | Focuses on waste pickup coordination | Limited community interaction |
| TrashOut (Global)   | Allows users to report illegal dumps | Weak event management tools   |
| GreenHub            | Connects NGOs                        | Lacks municipal integration   |

**Reviwa** differentiates itself through a civic engagement-driven design that promotes transparency, collaboration, and local action.

## 9. Success Metrics

- Number of waste reports submitted per month
- Number of cleanup events created and completed
- Active partnerships with NGOs or municipalities
- User engagement rate (monthly active users)

---

## 10. Deliverables

- Functional MVP web app
- Documentation (README, SDLC docs)
- Deployment and demo
- Business and impact report

## 11. Risks and Mitigation

| Risk                  | Mitigation Strategy                              |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Low user engagement   | Gamify reporting and event participation         |
| Funding constraints   | Early partnerships and CSR outreach              |
| Data integrity issues | Implement moderation tools                       |
| Technical scalability | Use cloud infrastructure (MongoDB Atlas, Vercel) |
