## Mobile Considerations

- Responsive design: Stack elements vertically on small screens
- Touch-friendly buttons and inputs

## Notes

- Use consistent color scheme (e.g., blue for primary actions)
- Ensure accessibility: Alt text for images, keyboard navigation
- Low-fi first: Focus on layout and flow, add details later
